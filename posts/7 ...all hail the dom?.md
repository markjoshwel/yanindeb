# …all hail the dom?

i did not expect this week to only have one activity, huh.

Anyways, DOM Manipulation! Cool stuff. Wonder how much of it frameworks like React and the like abstract it away.

i can’t really think of anything to say so here’s a code snippet

```js
var elements = document.getElementsByTagName("li");

for (var i = 0; i < elements.length; i++) {
  if (elements[i].classList.contains("uh")) {
    elements[i].className = "yea";
    break;
  }
}
```

waow so cool (real submission code btw)
