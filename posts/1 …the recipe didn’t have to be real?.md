It’s Week 2 at time of writing, so this is just my retrospective on Week 1’s class.  
Week 1 was pretty fun I guess, definitely did not expect to see 97 slides though

I did know about most of the HTML tags presented, but I shan’t say more considering
I `<div>`-ed my way through [my first few websites](https://markjoshwel.github.io/portfolio-eae/).

mb but can you really blame me? it worked (and that’s all that mattered then!)  
_psst: i’ll talk more about semantics in my mandatory blogging of Week 2_

anyways

I find web development pretty fun as a developer and a “creative”, so the class is
genuinely quite enjoyable, especially when you forget Continual Assessments (CAs)
and Assignments exist.

The “star CA” of the week was the recipe card, where
[I bodged one up pretty quickly.](https://replit.com/@csplyric/wk01-CA-MakeARecipe)

Considering I had an inkling of CSS knowledge, I also (very much unnecessarily) styled
it a bit because my inner designer was like a devil on my shoulder during the CA.

I imported a Google Font and (attempted to) pretty up the text and layout.  
(don’t mind the weird top padding, it was a bodge anyways)

also nobody told me it didn’t have to be real recipe  
so after thinking for a bit without prevail, i just used a sata andagi recipe

…definitely not because azumanga daioh was plaguing my mind at the time
_(whaaat? nooo, you’re crazy)_

ok that’s it thanks for reading my first actual blog post on the interwebs  
p.s., **can you tell i’m not really a writer?**
