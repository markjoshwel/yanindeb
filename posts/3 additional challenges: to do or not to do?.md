# additional challenges: to do or not to do?

i’m surprised it’s already the third week…  
\_:(´ཀ`」 ∠):\_

I don’t have much to say this week, considering that I also know quite abit about
CSS selectors, positioning and media queries. I’ve used them extensively in my past
projects, so I’m not too worried about this week’s Tutorial.

```css
/* css line excerpts from the old fluffy website */
/* excuse my flagrant use of tailwindcss */
header #padbelow { @apply flex flex-col justify-end items-center h-full }
header #padbelow svg { @apply invert h-16 w-16 justify-self-end animate-bounce }
header #padbelow p { @apply smalltext pb-8 sm:pb-14 md:pb-24}
footer p { @apply !mt-2 }
footer p a { @apply smalltext-hover }
```

That said — additional challenges! To do or not to do? I’m very much capable of doing
them, but should I? I’d love to but work from my other modules are not piling up per se,
but looming over like a dark cloud. Sorry teach!

Since this week is also submission week — you’re probably the lecturer reading this —
hi? I would’ve liked to submit something of higher polish, but I have “my reasons”.

As of [yanindeb](https://github.com/markjoshwel/yanindeb) commit `6d77096322`:

- The website is not responsive
- Paragraphs do not look like chat bubbles
- Certain elements (like quotes and code blocks) are improperly or flat out not styled

i’ll get to these eventually  
(let me slave away at autodesk maya first brb)

until then, see ya!
