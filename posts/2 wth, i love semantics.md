# wth, i love semantics

hello there again

I quite like how deep the module is going into semantics early in, (as it should),
especially because I started off myself doing exactly the opposite. (oops!)

I learnt quite quickly after my first few websites that semantic HTML is a win-win for
everyone involved:

1. Website source code is much easier to read, write and maintain
2. Screen readers and other assistive technologies can parse the page much more easily
3. Search engines can parse the page much more easily

And I think it’d be a waste to throw any of these out, so great news we’re learning it
first and foremost. :D

This week also dove a bit into CSS and Typography, which are things I’ve also had a
hand at before, so I’m not too worried about those.

Note to self: the typographic element diagram is a little funny; Apertures are the
openings between an Open Counter and the outside of a letterform!

Also: counters can be “open counters”, like in the letters ‘c’, ‘f’, ‘h’ and ‘s’;
or “closed counters”, like in the letters ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘d’, ‘e’, ‘g’, ‘o’, ‘p’, and ‘q’.

tbh i still mix up margin and padding to this day

Nothing too fancy with this week’s CAs, just your usual.

and i know the slides say not to rely solely on w3schools, but their
[CSS selector reference](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.php) is pretty
good (￣ω￣;)

Also for one of the CAs, I wanted to use some (open-source) fonts that weren’t on Google
Fonts, so I ended up just hardcoding `https://id.joshwel.co/font/*` URLs. (oooops!)

speaking of which: quick shoutout to
[Death to Typography](https://deathoftypography.com/), a Singaporean type foundry and
collective that help incubate and host mostly open-source fonts. (with exception!)

they’re making and doing some dandy things so if you or someone you know is/are doing a
type project (or have already done one) — you can apply for their font incubation
programme!! or even just host a font w/ em!!

theyre supported by [designing cultures studio](https://www.designingculturesstudio.com/),, a local design and research studio ^-^

that’s it for this week, see ya!
