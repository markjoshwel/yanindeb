        <p>hello there again</p>

          I quite like how deep the module is going into semantics early in, (as
          it should), especially because I started off myself doing exactly the
          opposite. (oops!)
        </p>
        <p>
          I learnt quite quickly after my first few websites that semantic HTML
          is a win-win for everyone involved:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Website source code is much easier to read, write and maintain
          </li>
          <li>
            Screen readers and other assistive technologies can parse the page
            much more easily
          </li>
          <li>Search engines can parse the page much more easily</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          And I think it’d be a waste to throw any of these out, so great news
          we’re learning it first and foremost. :D

          This week also dove a bit into CSS and Typography, which are things
          I’ve also had a hand at before, so I’m not too worried about those.<br />
          Nothing too fancy with this week’s CAs, just your usual.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note to self: the typographic element diagram is a little funny;
          Apertures are the openings between an Open Counter and the outside of
          a letterform!<br />
          Also: counters can be “open counters”, like in the letters ‘c’, ‘f’,
          ‘h’ and ‘s’; or “closed counters”, like in the letters ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘d’,
          ‘e’, ‘g’, ‘o’, ‘p’, and ‘q’.
        </p>
        <p>
          tbh i still mix up margin and padding to this day<br />
          and i know the slides say not to rely solely on w3schools, but their
          <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.php"
            >CSS selector reference</a
          >
          is pretty good (￣ω￣;)

          Also for one of the CAs, I wanted to use some (open-source) fonts that
          weren’t on Google Fonts, so I ended up just hardcoding
          <code>https://id.joshwel.co/font/*</code> URLs. (oooops!)
        </p>
        <p>
          speaking of which: quick shoutout to
          <a href="https://deathoftypography.com/">Death to Typography</a>, a
          Singaporean type foundry and collective that help incubate and host
          mostly open-source fonts. (with exception!)
        </p>
        <p>
          they’re making and doing some dandy things so if you or someone you
          know is/are doing a type project (or have already done one) — you can
          apply for their font incubation programme!! or even just host a font
          w/ em!!
