          It’s Week 2 at time of writing, so this is just my retrospective on
          Week 1’s class.<br />
          Week 1 was pretty fun I guess, definitely did not expect to see 97
          slides though
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="https://files.catbox.moe/pc8jkg.jpg"
            alt='Picture of a frustrated Chiyo-chan from Azumanga Daioh, with the caption "She thought school was for one day only! She MAD!!"'
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          I did know about most of the HTML tags presented, but I shan’t say
          more considering I <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>-ed my way through
          <a href="https://markjoshwel.github.io/portfolio-eae/"
            >my first few websites</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          mb but can you really blame me? it worked (and that’s all that
          mattered then!)<br />
          <em
            >psst: i’ll talk more about semantics in my mandatory blogging of
            Week 2</em
          >

          I find web development pretty fun as a developer and a “creative”, so
          the class is genuinely quite enjoyable, especially when you forget
          Continual Assessments (CAs) and Assignments exist.
        </p>
        <p>
          The “star CA” of the week was the recipe card, where
          <a href="https://replit.com/@csplyric/wk01-CA-MakeARecipe"
            >I bodged one up pretty quickly.</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Considering I had an inkling of CSS knowledge, I also (very much
          unnecessarily) styled it a bit because my inner designer was like a
          devil on my shoulder during the CA.
        </p>
        <p>
          I imported a Google Font and (attempted to) pretty up the text and
          layout.<br />
          (don’t mind the weird top padding, it was a bodge anyways)
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="s4">
        <p>
          also nobody told me it didn’t have to be real recipe<br />
          so after thinking for a bit without prevail, i just used a sata andagi
          recipe
        </p>
        <p>
          …definitely not because azumanga daioh was plaguing my mind at the
          time <em>(whaaat? nooo, you’re crazy)</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          ok that’s it thanks for reading my first actual blog post on the
          interwebs<br />
          p.s., <strong>can you tell i’m not really a writer?</strong>
